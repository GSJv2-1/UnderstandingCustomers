I imported Pandas to read the data file.  I also imported Numpy and Matplotlib for graphing.

In task 1, I mainly used the Groupby function to answer the posed questions.  I was able to use 'count' and 'sum' to ascertain relationships with the demographics data.

I converted scientific numbers using a calulator.

I think the scatter plot gave me a good visual of sales by region.
